### ‚ùóImportant
Always rebuild image when installing package with pipenv. The command should be run sequentially as below:
1. ```pipenv install <package_name>```
2. ```pipenv requirements > requirements.txt```
3. ```docker compose up -d --build```

# Database migration
1. Run `docker compose exec app python manage.py migrate` to migrate the database
    ```
    docker compose exec app python manage.py migrate
    ```

# Create superuser
1. Create superuser to access the local django admin panel
    ```
    docker compose exec app python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```
2. Once the superuser is created, access the django admin panel on [Admin panel](http://localhost:8000/admin) with the username and password.

# Using the APIs
1. **Registration**: Submit a post request to http://localhost:8000/analytics/api/v1/register/ with the example json body below.
    ```
    {
        "username": <username>,
        "password": <password>
    }
    ```
2. **Login**: Submit a post request to http://localhost:8000/analytics/api/v1/login/ with the example json body below. A token will be returned in the response body, keep this token for other API requests.
    ```
    {
        "username": <username>,
        "password": <password>
    }
    ```
3. Requesting to the API should include the auth token in the request header `Token xxxxxx`. Example in get request to http://localhost:8000/analytics/api/v1/campaigns/

    curl --request GET \
    --url http://localhost:8000/analytics/api/v1/campaigns/ \
    --header 'Authorization: Token <your_token>'
    ```
